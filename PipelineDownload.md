# Pipeline Download #

The Pipeline Genomics and Informatics Environment [may be downloaded here](http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu/downloads/). This includes, client-server downloads, a virtual Pipeline server installation and a distributed Pipeline server.


## Pipeline Client-Server Download ##
[Download the latest version of the Pipeline Environment](http://www.loni.ucla.edu/Software/Software_License.jsp?software_id=2).


## Download DPS ##
[Distributed Pipeline Server](http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu/downloads/dps/) installation allows you to build and configure 3 types of resources â€“ backend Grid management resources (e.g., Oracle Grid Engine), the distributed Pipeline server, and a number of computational imaging and informatics software tools.
LONI Pipeline Neuroimaging Virtual Environment (PNVE)

## Download PNVE ##
The [LONI Pipeline Neuroimaging Virtual Environment (PNVE)](http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu/downloads/pnve/), is a self-contained virtual machine that can be executed on a common laptop or desktop, enabling the Pipeline to run virtually anywhere.

## Pipeline Grid Plugins ##
Starting from version 4.4 developers have opportunity to create their own plugins for Pipeline to communicate with various Grid managers. Pipeline package contains two built-in plugins for Oracle Grid Engine (previously known as Sun Grid Engine) which are JGDIPlugin and DRMAAPlugin. In installed package of Pipeline, under the lib directory there is directory called plugins in which you can find these two plugins. However, from here you can download each plugin seperately.

**[Download DRMAA plugin](http://users.loni.ucla.edu/%7Epipelnv4/gridplugins/drmaa_plugin.tar.gz) (Version 1.1. Last updated Spet.  17,  2010)** [Download JGDI plugin](http://users.loni.ucla.edu/%7Epipelnv4/gridplugins/jgdi_plugin.tar.gz) (Version 1.2. Last updated Spet. 14, 2010)

For more information on how to set up Pipeline Grid Plugin, please refer to Server Guide.

## Download Smartline Conversion Program ##
[Download Smartline Conversion Program](http://users.loni.ucla.edu/~pipelnv4/smartline/smartline-dist.tar.gz) for Pipeline server. If you are setting up your own Pipeline server, you have to install this program on your server so that workflows with Smartline can be run on your server. Please follow the instructions in the downloaded package.
